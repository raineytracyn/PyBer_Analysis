## 1. The purpose
### The purpose of this analysis is to showcase a DataFrame of the riding-sharing data provided by city type, as well as a multiple-line graph that shows the fares for each city type.

## 1. Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types
###### ![Total Fares by city type](https://github.com/raineytracyn/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Fig8.png)
### To start, some obviously items to point out:
* While the lowest total rate, rural was the most stable.
* Suburban shows to be steady overall, with spikes on specific dates, likely due to an increase in demand
* Urbanâ€™s totals were the highest total, showing an overall increase from Jan to the end of April. The month of Mar demonstrated up and down fare totals.
### The three lines demonstrate there is a drastically different need and use of ride-sharing depending on the city type. For those living in rural areas, they may need to only go 3 streets over, whereas someone living in an Urban area might sit in traffic for two hours before getting to their destination. Suburban areas is tricky as those can drastically vary in size from state to state. It would be important to define what makes a city/town a rural/suburban/urban area. The FAA may be a good reference and starting point, because they have done a good job at defining this to help pilots understand what altitude they should stay at when flying over a populated area.
## 2. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
